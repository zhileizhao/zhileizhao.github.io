My scientific training is in the fields of _neurobiology_ and _evolutionary biology_.
While broadly interested in any cool sciences in these two fields, I'm especially fascinated by their intersection: _evolutionary neurobiology_.    

This is a relatively young field, since majority of neuroscientists work on a few model organisms without comparative thinking in mind. Meanwhile, although evolutionary biologists have been studying evolution of behaviors ever since Darwin, they didn't focus on the underlying neurobiological mechanisms. This gap is also partly caused by technical difficulties of working with non-model organisms, where access to neural circuits is rarely available. However, thanks to the recent advances of genome editing technologies like CRISPR/Cas9, this situation is changing rapidly.      

Evolutionary/comparative thinking plays essential roles in neurobiology, if our goal is to really understand the principles of how neural circuits mediate complex behaviors, not only case studies in a few model organisms. All neural circuits, no matter in fruit flies, mice or humans, are evolved from a common ancestor. Since [evolution is a tinker](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/196/4295/1161), instead of an engineer, the vast complexity we see with the billions of neurons in human brain, is a result of ever struggling for existence and descent with modifications, rather than omniscient designing from scratch. We can only understand it when we compare to other species, and find out what have conserved while what have changed.
