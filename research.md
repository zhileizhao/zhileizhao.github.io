My research interest and training are in the fields of _neurobiology_ and _evolutionary biology_.
While broadly interested in any cool sciences in these two fields, I'm especially fascinated with their intersection: <span style="color:HotPink">_evolutionary neurobiology_</span>.

Evolutionary or comparative thinking will play essential roles in neurobiology, if our goal is to

really understand the principles of how neural circuits mediate complex behaviors and cognition, not only case studies in a few model organisms. All neural circuits, no matter in fruit flies, mice or humans, are evolved from a common ancestor.
The vast complexity we face with billions of neurons in human brain, is the result of ever struggling for existence and descent with modifications, rather than design from scratch. We can fully understand the principles only when we compare between species, and document what are conserved, what have changed, and what have converged during evolution.


### Study system: evolution of olfactory circuits in mosquitoes
Careful choice of study system is critical. During my PhD research, I've been focusing on the <ins>[evolution of olfactory circuits](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00359-020-01399-6)</ins> in the <ins>[_Aedes aegypti_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedes_aegypti)</ins> mosquitoes. We believe it's a fantastic system to understand the principles of how neural circuits evolve, along with important practical applications.

_Aedes aegypti_ was originated in Africa, but rapidly spread throughout tropics and subtropics over the last 500 years. Although the ancestral form in Africa is generalist, using many animal species as hosts for blood-feeding, the derived form outside Africa became specialist on humans. Many behaviors have changed during this specialization event, among which is their strong preference for human body odor, over the odor of non-human animals. The question we want to understand is:  <span style="color:HotPink">what have changed in the olfactory circuits of mosquitoes during evolution to drive this shift to human hosts?</span>

Our research also has important practical applications, just imagine if we can alter the host preference of these dangerous mosquitoes once we understand how it works!


### Development of neurogenetic tools in mosquitoes
Although non-model organisms have all those cool behaviors, one challenge of working with them, is the limited number of tools that are available, especially neurogenetic reagents that provide access to neural circuits. In _Drosophila_ or other model organisms, the conventional method of generating transgenic lines is fusing the promoter of target gene to a report or effector, then inserting into random location of the genome. Unfortunately in mosquitoes, this method performs poorly, which underlies the scarcity of neurogenetic reagents. To answer the interesting biological questions, we first needed to create those reagents ourselves. Therefore, a substantial portion of my PhD work was devoted to the development of neurogenetic tools in _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes. <span style="color:HotPink">The ultimate goal is to make _Aedes aegypti_ a neurogenetically tractable organism.</span>  

We took advantage of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology and inserted transgene
<img align="right" src="/images/brp_staining.PNG" style="width:250px;height:203px;"> constructs into the native loci of various neural genes. The genes we targeted include both pan-neuronal and cell-type-specific genes, e.g. genes that are expressed specifically in olfactory receptor neurons or projection neurons. Although this method can faithfully capture the expression pattern of target genes, the possibility of obtaining a positive line is quite low (<1%), which means a lot of work and time to generate one line (>6 months). Despite these hurdles, we successfully generated <ins>[many lines](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.22.262527v1)</ins> that we envision will be broadly useful for this field.
