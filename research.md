My scientific training is in the fields of _neurobiology_ and _evolutionary biology_.
While broadly interested in any cool sciences in these two fields, I'm especially fascinated by their intersection: _evolutionary neurobiology_.      

Evolutionary/comparative thinking plays essential roles in neurobiology, if our goal is to really understand the principles of how neural circuits mediate complex behaviors, not only case studies in a few model organisms. All neural circuits, no matter in fruit flies, mice or humans, are evolved from a common ancestor. Since [evolution is a tinker](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/196/4295/1161), the vast complexity we see with billions of neurons in human brain, is the result of ever struggling for existence and descent with modifications, rather than omniscient designing from scratch. We can only understand it when we compare it to other species, and find out what have conserved, what have changed and what have converged.

Evolutionary neurobiology is a relatively young field, since majority of neuroscientists focus on a few model organisms without comparative thinking in mind. Meanwhile, although evolutionary biologists have been studying evolution of behaviors ever since Darwin, they didn't work on the underlying neurobiological mechanisms. This gap is also partly caused by technical difficulties of working with non-model organisms, where access to neural circuits is rarely available. However, thanks to the recent advances of genome editing technologies like CRISPR/Cas9, this situation is changing rapidly, creating unprecedented opportunities to do comparative work at the neural circuit level.     

### Evolution of olfactory circuits in mosquitoes
Among millions of animal species that have nervous system, careful choice of study system is critical. During my PhD research, I've been focusing on the [evolution of olfactory circuits](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00359-020-01399-6) in the [_Aedes aegypti_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedes_aegypti) mosquitoes. We believe it's a fantastic system to understand the principles of how neural circuits evolve, along with important practical applications.
