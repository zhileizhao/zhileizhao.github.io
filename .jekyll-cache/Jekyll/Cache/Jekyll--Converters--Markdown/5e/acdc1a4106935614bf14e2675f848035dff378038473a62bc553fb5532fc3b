I"<p>My scientific training is in the fields of <em>neurobiology</em> and <em>evolutionary biology</em>.
While broadly interested in any cool sciences in these two fields, I’m especially fascinated by their intersection: <em>evolutionary neurobiology</em>.</p>

<p>This is a relatively young field, since majority of neuroscientists work on a few model organisms. Meanwhile, although evolutionary biologists have been studying evolution of behaviors ever since Darwin, they didn’t focus on the underlying neurobiological mechanisms. This gap is also partly caused by the technical difficulties of working with non-model organisms, where access to neural circuits is rarely available.</p>
