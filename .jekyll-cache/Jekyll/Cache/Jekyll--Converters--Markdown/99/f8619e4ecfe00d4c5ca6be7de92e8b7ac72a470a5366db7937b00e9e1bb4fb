I"<p>My scientific training is in the fields of <em>neurobiology</em> and <em>evolutionary biology</em>.
While broadly interested in any cool sciences in these two fields, I’m especially fascinated by their intersection: <em>evolutionary neurobiology</em>.</p>

<p>This is a relatively young field, since majority of neuroscientists work on a few model organisms without comparative thinking in mind. Meanwhile, although evolutionary biologists have been studying evolution of behaviors ever since Darwin, they didn’t focus on the underlying neurobiological mechanisms. This gap is also partly caused by technical difficulties of working with non-model organisms, where access to neural circuits is rarely available. However, thanks to the recent advances of genome editing technologies like CRISPR/Cas9, this situation is changing rapidly.</p>

<p>Evolutionary/comparative perspective plays essential roles in neurobiology, if our goal is to really understand the principles of how neural circuits mediate complex behaviors. All neural circuits, no matter in fruit flies or mice, are evolved from a common ancestor. Since evolution is a tinker, instead of an engineer,</p>
