I"½<p>My scientific training is in the fields of <em>neurobiology</em> and <em>evolutionary biology</em>.
While broadly interested in any cool sciences in these two fields, Iâ€™m especially fascinated by their intersection: <em>evolutionary neurobiology</em>.   <br />
This is a relatively young field, since majority of neuroscientists work on a few model organisms. Meanwhile, although evolutionary biologists have been studying evolution of behaviors ever since Darwin, they didnâ€™t focus on the neurobiological mechanisms underlying behaviors. This gap is also partly caused by the technical difficulties of working with non-model organisms, where access to neural circuits is rarely available.</p>
