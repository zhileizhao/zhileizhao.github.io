I"±<p>My scientific training is in the fields of <em>neurobiology</em> and <em>evolutionary biology</em>.
While broadly interested in any cool sciences in these two fields, Iâ€™m especially fascinated by their intersection: <em>evolutionary neurobiology</em>.</p>

<p>This is a relatively young field, since majority of neuroscientists work on a few model organisms without comparative thinking in mind. Meanwhile, although evolutionary biologists have been studying evolution of behaviors ever since Darwin, they didnâ€™t focus on the underlying neurobiological mechanisms. This gap is also partly caused by technical difficulties of working with non-model organisms, where access to neural circuits is rarely available. Thanks to the recent advances of genome editing technologies like CRISPR/Cas9, this situation is changing rapidly.</p>
