I"<p>My scientific training is in the fields of <em>neurobiology</em> and <em>evolutionary biology</em>.
While broadly interested in any cool sciences in these two fields, I’m especially fascinated by their intersection: <em>evolutionary neurobiology</em>. This is a relatively young field, since majority of neuroscientists work on a few model organisms. Meanwhile, though evolutionary biologists have been studying evolution of behaviors ever since Darwin, they didn’t focus on the neurobiological mechanisms underlying behaviors.</p>
